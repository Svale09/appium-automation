# Appium Automation
This is a repo containing the whole code made for the final thesis on the theme of mobile automation on iOS and Android platforms using Appium as the main framework. The complete final thesis is available on the following link https://dabar.srce.hr/islandora/object/etfos%3A4329. In this project, a set of four most important test cases were chosen and subsequently automated.

## Project Structure
The project follows the POM (page object model) design pattern where each POM file represents a single screen in the app. The POM file contains all elements and methods for interacting with the said elements.

## Test Execution
The test execution is done by running the .xml files, one for Android and one for iOS tests, in which the tests are listed in order of execution. Because the whole project is done for The Phoenix application, but on a development version of the app, the test cannot be executed by cloning the repository and running the .xml files. For an example of test execution see the attached videos showing the test execution.
